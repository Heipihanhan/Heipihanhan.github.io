 <h3>Our project investigates the international response to the Syrian refugee crisis, comparing actions to words. There goes a Syrian proverb that reads “yali eido bil may, mu metl eli eido bl nar”, which could be loosely translated as “He, whose hand is in the water, doesn’t compare himself to those whose hand is in the fire”. In other words, regarding the Syrian refugee crisis, is it true that countries doing the heavy-lifting work are the countries that were talked about the least in the news? Or vise versa. </h3>

 <h3>On April 15th, 2011, a revolution broke out in southern Syria, and shortly afterwards, it spread to the rest of the country. By mid June that year, the government military cracked down on the demonstrations, which caused the first wave of displacement internally and externally, from Syria into neighboring countries, starting what we know today as the Syrian Refugee Crisis. It is the biggest forced migration in the history of the Middle East, and the largest population movement since World War II. </h3>

 <h3>Since 2011, the world map has changed, and continues to change, to Syrians fleeing the war to become refugees later, as well as to any Syrian passport-holders who would then seek asylums in countries they happened to visit. 
<br>

<br>
 The Syrian refugee crisis has sent shock waves across the globe. In Europe and North America specificaly, the Syrian refugee crisis has stirred up mixed emotions and reactions, and in some cases, has divided the society on issues such as inclusion, security, and foreign policy, evolving beyond a humanitarian crisis to a political chaos, where talking points arose and media buzz reveberated.

            This map was produced by Juan Pablo Alperin (<a href="https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=juancommander">@juancommander</a>) using
            <a href="http://d3js.org">d3.js</a> and <a href="https://github.com/shawnbot/d3-cartogram/">cartogram.js</a>.
            It was inspired by the out of date map over at <a href="http://worldmapper.org/display.php?selected=205">worldmapper.org</a>.
            Unfortunately, not much has changed. Due to differences in the implementations, the two maps cannot be directly
            compared to one another.

    <h3>Using UNHCR data on admission of refugees and asylum seekers per country from 1968 to 2015, we redraw the map of the world from the persepctive of a Syrian refugee. Which countries are bigger, more likely to accept a Syrian refugee? And which countries are not? This cartogram offers us a caricature and reveals a constrasting picture. Over a span of almost five decades, we see the changes unfold over time. Especially, during the Syrian civil war, from 2011 to 2015, critical changes took place. Some are expected, some are surprises.
    <br>

    <br>
    What about the media buzz generated around Syrian refugees? Which countries were most frequently mentioned or discussed along with Syrian refugees in the news on the Internet? Using GDELT Country Timeline data from Google, we were able to produce a timeline graph of news intensity of all the countries ever associated with Syrian refugees in the news articles on the Internet.

    While there isn't a comprehensive way to accurately measure the news intensity about Syrian refugee from countries around the world, the GDELT Country Timeline data of news article mentions does shed some light on this issue, and we find significant differences between countries and continents.

     The top 10 countries mostly associated with Syrian refugees in the news consist of 6 Middle Eastern countries and 4 European countries. After we compare the news intensity they received from the media with the number of refugees and asylum seekers they took, we discovered something interesting and have come to a better understanding regarding the "Words vs. Actions" concept in state response to the largest population movement in the 21st Century.
